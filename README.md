f you find a bug or want to make a suggestion, then join my Discord server: https://discord.gg/pykzREcAuZ I will not consider adding features that are too cheaty, pointless or are just unrelated to this module.

IllegalMap is a ChatTriggers module that scans each Dungeon to give extra information to the user, like which rooms and puzzles are in the dungeon and exactly how many secrets there are before the dungeon even starts. The map also shows the user other useful information like the total secrets, death penalties, crypts, mimic and the current score right underneath the map so that the user never needs to look at the tab list. IllegalMap can be used on its own as your primary dungeon map, with significantly more features than any other map currently. IllegalMap is highly customizable through the /dmap command.

Note: Due to Hypixel's render distance limitation, not all of the dungeon will be visible from the starting room.

Go to the Releases page on Github and download the "IllegalMap.zip" file from the latest release.

In your Downloads folder, find the IllegalMap.zip file, right click it and click "Extract All" to extract its contents into a separate folder which will just be named "IllegalMap". This folder should contain an index.js file, a metadata.json file as well as the rest of the module's files. Click on the IllegalMap folder and hit Ctrl + C to copy it.

Go to your ChatTriggers modules folder. This will usually be located under .minecraft/config/ChatTriggers/modules, but you can find it easily by running the "/ct files" command in-game.

While in your modules folder, hit Ctrl + V to paste the IllegalMap folder. If you have an older version of IllegalMap installed, you might be prompted to replace old files with new ones, click replace.

If you already have Minecraft open, just run the "/ct load" command and it will reload all of your modules. If you don't have your game open currently, the module will be loaded once you launch it.

Run the "/dmap" command to open the config gui. If the gui does not open, double check that you've installed the module correctly. IllegalMap should appear in the "/ct modules" modules list. If it doesn't, then you haven't installed it correctly. If IllegalMap is there, then run "/ct console js" to open the js console. If there is a big wall of red text, copy it and send it to me via Discord.
